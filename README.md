The group [Electromagnetics and Potential fields](https://tu-freiberg.de/en/geophysics/electromagnetics-and-potential-methods-working-group) develops software and gives courses at [TU Bergakademie Freiberg](https://tu-freiberg.de)

Current members:
* [Thomas Günther](https://github.com/halbmy)
* [Ralph-Uwe Börner](https://github.com/ruboerner)
* [Jana Börner](https://github.com/boerner4)
* [Mathias Scheunert](https://github.com/mathias-scheunert)
* [Sascha Weit](https://github.com/s-weit)

Here, we will host repositories with material for different courses given for MSc (and BSc) students at our university:
* [Theory of Potential methods](https://github.com/ruboerner/Potential_Theory)
* [Theory of Electromagnetic methods](https://github.com/ruboerner/ThEM)
* [Numerical Simulation Methods in Geophysics](https://github.com/halbmy/NumericalGeophysics)
* [Inverse problems in Geophysics](https://github.com/halbmy/IJulia)
* [Introduction to Applied Geophysics](https://github.com/halbmy/GeophysicalMethods)
* Global Geophysics, and more

Furthermore, we will host software for teaching and research
* [FEMT2D - 2D MT with Finite Elements](https://github.com/ruboerner/FEMT2D)
* see also software of the [GIMLi group](https://github.com/gimli-org)

and different templates. We use Python and Julia for programming, and Quarto for preparing the texts.
